# Kart
The first kart we are going to make is less powerful, and is built to get an idea and learn, so that the ultimate CBR Kart is much, much better.

Budget : LKR100,000

# Objective
- Get it to move forward
- Be more powerful than a Bivel Kart

# Specs

- The kart is going to have a 100cc, single cylinder, 4 stroke engine, SOHC Valvetrian with a max stock power output of 8.08HP@7500RPM and 8.34Nm@5500RPM, a performance increases is to be expected with an ECU Remap + Full freeflow exhaust system.
- The Frame/Chassis of the kart is going to stainless steel.
- Tyres are sourced from scrapyards, wheelbarrows, scooters etc.
- Gauges, Cables, Braking systems, Pedals, Seat, Harness, Steering rack, Chains & Sprokets, Axles, Bearings are all either sourced from scrapyards, or custom built, or bought to save weight and be light on our budget.

## Parts & Materials
We've decided to cheap out wherever we can while still providing more power compared to a Bivel Kart, what we've decided to use:

### Engine
- Bajaj CT100 Engine + Carbeurator + Transmission : Why? They are very cheap and easy to find
- Custom welded headers and downpipe
- Cables & Gauges.
- Chain & Sproket from a CT100, or Bajaj Platina

### Axles, Steering rack & Columns
- Custom welded axles
- Likely a custom welded steering system or sourced from an ATV Quad Bike or Kart

### Brakes, Clutch & Accerelator + Shifter
- Front braking system borrowed from a scooter like a Honda Dio
- Brake, Clutch & Accelerator cables and pedals are sourced from or custom built

### Tyres
- As karting tyres are expensive, we will have to resort to small scooter tyres or any other smaller & cheaper option that can reduce the performance & financial cost.

# Current problems
- **Sourcing the engine**, proves to be difficult and likely the most expensive and time consuming part of building this kart, we have decided to check popular scrap yard areas in search of full ct 100 engine & other useful parts as they are very common and cheap.

# Day 4 - 9/5/2025
- Switching to a Birel kart chassis instead of our own since our main goal is performance
- Advantages from our before chassis include a faster kart, lighter kart, lower CG (Center of Gravity), Nimble and agile
