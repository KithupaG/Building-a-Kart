Building a DIY Kart

# What this repo is about?
- Documenting our own DIY Kart from A to Z

# Who is this repo for?
- For all people who are into automotive/mechanical engineering
- For automotive enthusiasts

This is just a fun DIY project that will later be taken into competitive areas by scaling the kart into a race-ready beast.

# Future Goals
- Building a basic functioning kart
- Implementing performance mods to the kart such as: free-flow headers, downpipes, ecu remapping etc, aero kits etc.
- Scaling the kart, Our goal is to implement a tuned 600CC CBR Engine on a formula 1 style chassis, that can attack highly technical tracks and perform powerful runs on the drag-strip
